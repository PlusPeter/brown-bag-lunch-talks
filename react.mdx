# HTML

<Code>

```
<p>In a standard <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML">HTML</a> &amp; CSS page, you'd use HTML markup to organize / structure the page.</p>
<p>On page load, HTML is parsed by the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model">Document Object Model</a> and it then represents the structure of the page in memory.</p>
```

# React

1. Virtual DOM
2. One-way binding
3. Hydration

# Virtual DOM
<PP>
In a React-rendered page, one of the chief differences is that React uses a Virtual DOM which is much more efficient at managing the difference between the last render and the next render. This abstraction allows us to declare the state of the application, and React manages the DOM to make sure it matches that state. Additionally, React's Virtual DOM has an underlying concept called "Fibers" (think memory-threads) which allow it to make more judicious updates of the application and render it more efficiently than raw HTML.

# One-way (Unidirectional) Binding
<PP>
If you've worked with other JavaScript frameworks, you may be familiar with two-way binding &mdash; a circular hell where property and event binding is used to pass data from parent to child <em>and</em> child to parent.
