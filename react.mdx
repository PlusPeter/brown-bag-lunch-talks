# HTML
<Code>

```
<p>In a standard <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML">HTML</a> &amp; CSS page, you'd use HTML markup to organize / structure the page.</p>
<p>On page load, HTML is parsed by the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model">Document Object Model</a> and rendered to the page.</p>
```

</Code>

# React

In a React-rendered page, one of the chief differences is that React uses a Virtual DOM which is much more efficient at managing the difference between the last render and the next render.

This gives us faster successive renders.
