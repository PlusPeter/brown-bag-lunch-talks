## Biological Evolution

Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace üêí
</small>

<br />
<br />

<PP>
Evolution is change in the heritable characteristics of biological populations over successive generations.
</PP>

<Notes>
These characteristics are the expressions of genes that are passed on from parent to offspring during reproduction. Different characteristics tend to exist within any given population as a result of mutation, genetic recombination and other sources of genetic variation. Evolution occurs when evolutionary processes such as natural selection (including sexual selection) and genetic drift act on this variation, resulting in certain characteristics becoming more common or rare within a population.

## Evolutionary computation

<PP>
In computer science, evolutionary computation is a family of algorithms for global optimization inspired by biological evolution, and the subfield of artificial intelligence and soft computing studying these algorithms.
</PP>

<Notes>
In technical terms, they are a family of population-based trial and error problem solvers with a metaheuristic or stochastic optimization character.
</Notes>

---

## Evolutionary algorithms

<PP>
In computational intelligence (CI), an evolutionary algorithm (EA) is a subset of evolutionary computation,a generic population-based metaheuristic optimization algorithm. An EA uses mechanisms inspired by <strong>biological evolution</strong>, such as <strong>reproduction, mutation, recombination, and selection</strong>
</PP>

<Notes>
Candidate solutions to the optimization problem play the role of individuals in a population, and the fitness function determines the quality of the solutions. Evolution of the population then takes place after the repeated application of the above operators.
</Notes>

## Implementation

<PP>
  <ul>
    Step 1
    <li>Generate the initial population of individuals randomly. (First generation)</li>
  </ul>


  <ul>
    Step 2
    <Steps>
      <li>Evaluate the fitness of each individual in the population.</li>
      <li>Select the fittest individuals for reproduction.</li>
      <li>Breed new individuals through crossover and mutation operations to give birth to offspring.</li>
      <li>Replace the least-fit individuals of the population with new individuals.</li>
    </Steps>
  </ul>

## Traveling Salesman problem (TSP)

<PP>
Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?"

## Implementation

A matrix to represent a simlar graph can be represented as:
<Log value={`
const dists = {
    "a": [ 0, 10, 15, 20, 30 ],
    "b": [ 10, 0, 35, 25, 20 ],
    "c": [ 15, 35, 0, 30, 25 ],
    "d": [ 20, 25, 30, 0, 30 ],
    "e": [ 30, 20, 25, 30, 0 ],
}
`} />

One path can be:
<Log value={`
const path = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"]
`} />

---

## Implementation

In order to calculate a distance we have:
<Log value={`
const calcDist = (path) => {
  return path.map((p, i) => {
      let next = 0
      if (i < path.length-2) {
          next = i+1
      }
      return dists[p][next]
  }).reduce((p, n) => {
      return p + n
  })
}
`} />

The total distance for:
<Log value={`
calcDist(["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"])
`} />
<Log value={ea().calcDist(["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"])} />

---

## Implementation

Using other permutations:
<Log value={`
calcDist(["a", "c", "b", "d", "e"])
`} />
<PP>Distance:</PP>
<Log value={ea().calcDist(["a", "c", "b", "d", "e"])} />
<Log value={`
calcDist(["a", "e", "c", "b", "d"])
`} />
<PP>Distance:</PP>
<Log value={ea().calcDist(["a", "e", "c", "b", "d"])} />


---

## Implementation

Let's create some species:
<Log value={`
const genome = (list) => {
    list.sort(() => Math.random() - 0.5)
    return [...list]
}
` + `
const species = (size) => {
    const sp = new Set()
    while (sp.size < size) {
        const g = genome(cities)
        sp.add(g.join(''))
    }
    return sp
}
`} />


Create 4 random species:
<Log value={"species(4)"} />

Each line is a genome that define a species:
<Log value={[...sp]} decode={true} />

<Notes>
  The species should be randomly generated with an equal distribution, 
  for this example is just a simple random
</Notes>

---

## Implementation

Calculate their fitness:
<Log value={`
const fitness = (sp) => {
    return [...sp].map((s) => {
        return { "genome": s, "distance": calcDist(s.split('')) }
    }).sort((a, b) => {
        return a.distance - b.distance
    })
}
`} />
<small>Less distance better fitness</small>
<Log value={fit} decode={true} />

---

## Implementation

Breed from most fitted by swapping one part of the path
<Log value={`
const offspring = (parent) => {
    const a = parent.split('')
    const max = a.length
    const x = Math.floor(Math.random() * Math.floor(max))
    const y = x+1 <= max ? x+1 : 0
    a[x] = a.splice(y,1, a[x])[0]
    const ofs = a.join("")
    return ofs
}
`} />

Parent:
<Log value={fit[0]} decode={true} />

Offspring:
<Log value={ea().offspring(fit[0].genome)} decode={true} />


<Notes>
  The fitness criteria and breeding are the 2 most important parts 
  of a genetic algorithm
</Notes>


---

## Implementation

Now we run the process for generations
<Log value={`
const generations = (size, spTotal, survRate) => {
    let sp = species(spTotal)
    for (let i=0; i<size; i++) {
        const generation = fitness(sp)
        const survivors = generation.slice(0, survRate)
            .map((a) => {
                return a.genome
            })
        const ofs = offspring(survivors[0])
        const mutation = species(1)
        const nextSpecies = mutation
        nextSpecies.add(ofs)
        nextSpecies.add(ofs)
        survivors.forEach(nextSpecies.add, nextSpecies)
        sp = nextSpecies
    }
    return sp
}
`} />


---

## Implementation


<Log value={`
generations(10,4,2)
`} />

10 generations, 4 initial species, 2 survivors per generation
<Log value={ea().generations(10,4,2)} decode={true} fSize="0.4em" />
