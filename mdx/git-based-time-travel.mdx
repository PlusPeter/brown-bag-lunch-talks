## Tips and Tricks

### for Time Travel

#### via git

<C>
  git clone https://github.com/PlusPeter/brown-bag-lunch-talks.git
  talks
  <br />
  git checkout time-travel
</C>

<Notes>
  Please clone this repo, check out this branch, and push some code.
  We'll go over some approaches for ameliorating insanity in a bit.
</Notes>

## 1. Commit frequently

<div>
  <PP>
    In order to go back in time, there has to be a destination to
    travel to.
    <br />
    The more you commit, the greater your potential landing points.
  </PP>
  <C>git commit -m "human readable information" --no-verify</C>
</div>

<Notes>
  high granularity (aka Walter style) vs. stable state
  <br />
  Having a large number of commits is sometimes great, but sometimes
  it is a pain in the ass.
  <br />
  If I'm rebasing and I know there's going to be a conflict, rebasing
  the branch to a single commit _before_ I rebase it against a common
  ancestor is a great approach. We'll discuss this in more detail in a
  few slides.
  <br />
  Git hooks allow you to mandate an acceptable state between commits
  (but have an escape hatch in the form of no-verify)
</Notes>

## 2. Increase redundancy

<div>
  <ol>
    <li>Your local branch is a version of the truth.</li>
    <li>Your local environment is a single copy of the shared truth.</li>
    <li>You can have multiple local copies of the same repo.</li>
    <li>You can have multiple remote copies.</li>
  </ol>
  <C>
    git clone https://github.com/PlusPeter/brown-bag-lunch-talks.git talks2
    <br />
    git checkout time-travel
    <br />
    git checkout -b backup/time-travel
  </C>
</div>

<Notes>
  Push code frequently. Your computer could crash at any time.
  Branch frequently. It costs you nothing.
  <br />
  Keeping multiple local copies allows you to keep multiple stable
  states. It also allows for greater potential copies of a shared
  history.
  <br />
  Having multiple remotes is sometimes a great way of having a
  protected state.
</Notes>

## 3. Know your tools

1. `git` is not a silver bullet
2. Fetch vs. Pull
3. Rebase vs. Merge

<Notes>
  git is powerful and useful, but I've seen foolish usage ruin codebases quickly.
</Notes>

---

## git

1. .git/config
2. CLI vs. GUI

<C>
  cat .git/config
  <br />
  git branch
  <br />
  git branch --all
</C>

<Notes>
  To each their own within a given space.
  <br />
  But knowing how to do things in the command line gives you power which a GUI tool doesn't always afford.
</Notes>

---

## Fetch vs. Pull

<PP>
Understanding the difference between these two things is
essential.
</PP>

* Fetching is asking what is on the menu.
* Pulling is like adoption.

<Notes>
  Here's a mixed metaphor!
  <br />
  Pulling is more dangerous (and costly) than fetching.
  <br />
  Having multiple copies helps protect you against (yourself) pulling
  <br />
  Having multiple repos helps protect you against others (and changes to shared history)
</Notes>

---

## Rebasing > Merging

<div>
  <PP>
    Use rebasing to keep a clean and sane actual / merged history.
  </PP>
  <C>
    git checkout development
    <br />
    git pull
    <br />
    git checkout -<br />
    git rebase -i development
  </C>
</div>

<Notes>
  Rebasing is more powerful than merging (but also more dangerous)
  <br />
  Having facility / knowledge of how to rebase in command line is much
  more portable than familiarity with a specific GUI
  <br />
  If your computer crashed or you have to debug on a machine that
  isn't yours, knowledge of how to rebase in the CLI is great
  <br />
  Remember that `--theirs` and `--ours` are flipped!
</Notes>

## Tricks

<div>
  <PP>Having lots of destinations can be overwhelming.</PP>
  <C>
    git log --all -- coolfile.nice
    <br />
    git log --all -- '**/my_file.png'
  </C>
  <PP>Having lots of destinations can be lifesaving.</PP>
  <C>
    git push my-source2 _branch_name_
    <br />
    git remote add bak /local/path/to/other/repo
    <br />
    git checkout branch -- some.file.only
  </C>
</div>
